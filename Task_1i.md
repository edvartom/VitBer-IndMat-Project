From the plot we observe that the area under the curve for Helmholtz free energy density, $F(u)$, increases with together with the temperature $\theta$. That is, the integral of $F(u)$ and therefore the mixing energy $\mathcal{E}_{mix}$ becomes larger with increasing temperature.
Additionally, we see that the graph for $F(u)$ has the same shape, minimum $u$ -coordinate, and maximum $u$ -coordinate regardless of $\theta$. We find that $u_{min}=\pm 1$ and $u_{max}=-0.002$.

## Suggested reformulation
The plot shows that increasing the temperature, $\theta$ leads to an increase in the area under curve $F$. From Ginzburg-Landau, we expect that increasing the integral of $F$ leadss to an increase in the mixing energy $\mathcal{E}_{mix}$. 

The plot also suggests that the $u$-coordinates which yield minimas and maximas, are independent of temperature. Specifically,  $u_{min}=\pm 1$ and $u_{max}=-0.002$, regardless of our choice of $\theta$.
